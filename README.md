We consider the relative entropy between cohortsâ€™ cfDNA fragment lengths

- Can we pinpoint particular lengths for which disease differs from healthy?
- Can we identify distinct differences for colorectal (CRC) as well as other cancer types (ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, breast, lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma)?

Preliminary Kullback-Leibler divergence (PMC5812299) analysis of the Delfi (PMC6774252) data shows:

- Healthy individuals and cancer patients exhibit differences for
particular fragment lengths
- Two or three peaks on the divergence histogram
- CRC patients and other cancers exhibit differences for particular
fragment lengths
- At least 8% of the fragments belong to diverging populations
