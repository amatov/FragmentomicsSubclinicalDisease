We consider the relative entropy between cohortsâ€™ cfDNA fragment lengths and test two hypotheses.

1. We can pinpoint particular lengths for which disease differs from healthy.

2. We can identify distinct differences for colorectal (CRC) as well as other cancer types (ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, breast, lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma)?

Preliminary Kullback-Leibler divergence (PMC5812299) analysis of the Delfi (PMC6774252) data shows:

1. Cancer vs healthy:

- Healthy individuals and cancer patients exhibit differences for
particular fragment lengths.
- We observe two to three peaks (see KLD_CRC_FRL.pdf) on the divergence histogram.

2. Cancer vs cancer:

- CRC patients and other cancers exhibit differences for particular
fragment lengths.
- At least 8% of the fragments belong to diverging populations.
