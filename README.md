We consider the relative entropy between cohortsâ€™ cfDNA fragment lengths.

- Can we pinpoint particular lengths for which disease differs from healthy?
- Can we identify distinct differences for colorectal (CRC) as well as other cancer types (ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, breast, lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma)?

Preliminary Kullback-Leibler divergence (PMC5812299) analysis of the Delfi (PMC6774252) data shows:

- Healthy individuals and cancer patients exhibit differences for
particular fragment lengths.
- We observe two to three peaks (see KLD_CRC_FRL.pdf) on the divergence histogram.
- CRC patients and other cancers exhibit differences for particular
fragment lengths.
- At least 8% of the fragments belong to diverging populations.
